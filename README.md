![Selenide Logo](https://selenide.org/images/selenide-logo-big.png)

This repository contains a demonstration of an architecture for automated UI testing using Selenide framework with Maven and TestNG.

## Overview

The Demo Selenide Architecture project showcases a structured approach to building and organizing automated UI tests using the Selenide framework with Maven and TestNG. It aims to provide a clear and maintainable architecture that facilitates scalability, readability, and reusability of UI test code.

## Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implementing a Page Object Model design pattern to represent web pages as Java classes, promoting code reusability and maintenance.
- **Selenide**: Leveraging the Selenide framework for writing concise and expressive UI tests with built-in support for WebDriver interactions.
- **Maven**: Utilizing Maven as the build automation tool to manage dependencies, build configurations, and project lifecycle.
- **TestNG Integration**: Integrating TestNG as the testing framework for organizing and executing test cases with annotations and assertions.
- **Reporting**: Generating comprehensive test reports for better visibility and analysis of test results.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Demo Selenide Architecture project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_URL>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `mvn clean test` to execute the sample test cases.
4. View the generated test reports located in the `target/reports` directory.

## Usage

You can use this project as a reference or starting point for your own automated UI testing projects. Here are some suggested actions:

- Customize the sample test cases to suit your application's UI features and functionality.
- Add new Page Object classes and methods to represent additional web pages and interactions.
- Extend the test suite by creating new test classes and organizing them according to your test scenarios.
- Update the Maven `pom.xml` file to include additional dependencies or customize the build settings.
